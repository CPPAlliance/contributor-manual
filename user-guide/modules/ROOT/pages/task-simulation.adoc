= Real-Time Simulation
:navtitle: Simulation

Creating a real-time simulation of vehicles involves various aspects, including physical modeling, concurrent programming for real-time response, data storage and manipulation, networking for multi-vehicle simulation, and perhaps a graphic interface. Here are some libraries that may be helpful:

[circle]
* boost:chrono[]: Timing is critical in real-time applications. This library can help you measure time intervals, which could be useful for controlling the timing of your simulation.

* boost:geometry[]: For spatial computations and geometric algorithms, which you will likely need for modeling the physical behavior and interactions of your vehicles.

* boost:units[]: Helps with calculations involving units of measurement. It provides classes and functions that can enforce the correct usage of units and conversions between them, which could be helpful in a physical simulation.
 
* boost:graph[]: In case you need to represent roads or pathways as a graph, this library provides a flexible and powerful way to represent and manipulate graphs. It also includes a number of graph algorithms.

* boost:thread[] or boost:asio[]: To achieve real-time performance, you might need to make use of multi-threading or asynchronous input/output. boost:thread[] provides classes and functions for multi-threading, synchronization, and inter-thread communication. boost:asio[] is a cross-platform library for asynchronous programming and can handle a lot of networking tasks as well.

* boost:interprocess[]: If you need to share data between different processes in real-time, this library can be useful. It supports shared memory, memory-mapped files, semaphores, and more.

* boost:mpi[] or boost:asio[]: For distributed simulations that run across multiple systems, you might need a library for network communication. boost:mpi[] provides a pass:[C++] interface for the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard for distributed computing. boost:asio[] can also handle networking tasks and it is a bit lower-level.

* boost:serialization[]: To save the state of the simulation or to communicate complex data structures over a network, you might find this library helpful.
