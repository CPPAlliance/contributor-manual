= High-Performance Database Engine
:navtitle: Database Engine

Creating a high-performance database application in pass:[C++] involves a range of tasks, including network communication, concurrent programming, memory management, and more. Here are some Boost libraries that might be useful:

* boost:asio[] : Provides a consistent asynchronous model using a modern pass:[C++] approach for network and low-level I/O programming. It supports a variety of network protocols, which could be helpful if your database needs to communicate over a network.

* boost:container[] : Provides STL-compatible containers, including stable vector, flat set/map and more. The containers provided by this library can offer performance benefits over their standard library equivalents, making them a good fit for a high-performance database application.

* boost:serialization[] : If you need to serialize objects for storage, boost:serialization[] can be a useful tool. However, be aware that for many database applications, more specialized serialization formats (like Protocol Buffers, Thrift, etc.) might be more appropriate.

* boost:thread[] : Provides a portable interface for multithreading, which can be crucial when creating a high-performance database that can handle multiple queries concurrently.

* boost:fiber[] : Provides a framework for micro-/userland-threads (fibers) scheduled cooperatively. Fibers can be used to simplify asynchronous programming, especially when there are many I/O operations, which is typical in database applications.

* boost:interprocess[] : This library allows for shared memory communication and synchronization between processes. In a database context, this can be useful for inter-process communication (IPC) and shared memory databases.

* boost:lockfree[] : Provides lock-free data structures which could be useful in multi-threaded database applications where you want to avoid locking overhead.

* boost:polygon[] or boost:geometry[] : For storing and querying spatial data, these libraries can provide the necessary data types and algorithms.

* boost:multiprecision[] : For handling high-precision numbers or calculations, this library can be useful.

* boost:pool[] : This library is used for simple, fast memory allocation and can improve efficiency in some scenarios by managing memory in chunks.

* boost:smart_ptr[] : It provides smart pointer class templates, which can be very helpful in managing resources and preventing memory leaks.
